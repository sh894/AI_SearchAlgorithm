AI_SearchAlgorithm
==================

generate 50 8-puzzle instances of a range of difficulty and solve them using A* (with the Manhattan distance heuristic), hill climbing, and simulated annealing, respectively, and compare the algorithm performances.
This is a programming assignment. You may work as a team of two persons and use any programming language you like. Each team submits one written report that includes
a.                               A description of how you generate or find the 8-puzzle instances, your implementation of the three algorithms, and the algorithm parameters you used in your experiments. You may use or modify existing code, such as the code at the AI online code repository.
b.                              A graph of solution cost (y-axis) vs. instance (x-axis), showing the cost of the solution (i.e., how many steps) for each of the 50 instances, by each of the three algorithms, with the instances sorted in increasing order based on the solution cost of A*.
c.                               A graph of the search cost (y-axis) vs. instance (x-axis), showing the number of nodes expanded or generated for each of the 50 instances, by each of the three algorithms, with the instances sorted in increasing order based on the solution cost of A*, i.e., the order of instances is the same as in the other graphs.
d.                              A graph of physical execution time (y-axis) vs. instance (x-axis), showing the physical execution time in seconds for each of the 50 instances, by each of the three algorithms, with the instances sorted in increasing order based on the solution cost of A*, i.e., the order of instances is the same as in the other graphs.
